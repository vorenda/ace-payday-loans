The state allows payday loans with significant consumer protections: loans are capped at $300 with a maximum fee of 15% (approximately $45). Rollovers are prohibited, meaning lenders cannot issue a new loan to pay off an existing one. California also prohibits lenders from making multiple loans to the same borrower simultaneously. All payday lenders operating in California must be licensed by the DFPI, and consumers can verify a lender's license status online or by calling 1-866-275-2677.",

    "aprDisclosure": "The typical Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for a payday loan in California is approximately 426-460% for a two-week loan. By comparison, credit cards typically have APRs between 15-30% and personal loans between 6-36%. The high APR reflects the short-term nature of payday loans and the fees charged. A $300 payday loan with a $45 fee repaid in 14 days has an APR of approximately 391%.",

Payday loans are high-cost, short-term loans with APRs that can exceed 400%. Before taking out a payday loan, consider alternatives such as personal loans, credit union loans, payment plans with creditors, or assistance from non-profit credit counseling agencies. Laws and regulations may change. For the most current information, contact the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation at 1-866-275-2677 or visit dfpi.ca.gov.
