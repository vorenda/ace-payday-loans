The state allows payday loans with significant consumer protections: loans are capped at $300 with a maximum fee of 15% (approximately $45). Rollovers are prohibited, meaning lenders cannot issue a new loan to pay off an existing one. California also prohibits lenders from making multiple loans to the same borrower simultaneously.

    "aprDisclosure": "The typical Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for a payday loan in California is approximately 426-460% for a two-week loan. By comparison, credit cards typically have APRs between 15-30% and personal loans between 6-36%. The high APR reflects the short-term nature of payday loans and the fees charged. A $300 payday loan with a $45 fee repaid in 14 days has an APR of approximately 391%.",

Laws and regulations may change. For the most current information, contact the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation at 1-866-275-2677 or visit dfpi.ca.gov.
